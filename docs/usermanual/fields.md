# Field Types

The plugin comes with several built-in fields to be used on the product page. 
Please contact us if you need to add new field types. 
We are working on the ability to build custom fields as extensions for the plugin. 
We would like to meet your expectations as much as possible.

Each field has its own parameters, but some parameters are the same for every field. See the list below:

|Parameter|Description|
|-|-|
|**Name**|Unique field name used in plugin code. It must consist of A-Z, a-z or underscore. For example: *product_width, table_height*, etc.|
|**Title**|Field name showed to the User. For example: *Product width, Table height*|
|**Hint for Customer**|Help message showed in tooltip. For example: *Please choose product color from the list.* |
|**CSS Class**|CSS class applied to the HTML code of the field. You can define additional styles in custom .css files in theme.|
|**Price**|If the field is filled in by the customer, the price will be used in the formula. Otherwise the price is 0. This parameter is not present for the: number field and select field.
