# About the Plugin

The plugin extends the Woocommerce store with the ability to add your own fields to the product page. 
Almost all fields are used in formulas to calculate a custom price for a product. 
The plugin allows full freedom to define fields and formulas for calculating the price.
Some of fields can be used to get informations from Customer (for example: text, date, date range, color, dropdown, etc.)

The plugin is designed to work with multisite mode. We encourage you to contact us and request new features.

## Definitions

- **Field** - is used to get user's input on the product page. Field can be used to calculate the price (is used in formula)
- **Fieldset** - store manager can create the fieldset which consists of different **Fields**. Fieldset must have at least one **Field** and the expression (formula) to calculate the product price
- **Expression/Formula** - mathematical and/or logical expression using to calculate the product price. The expression can be single-line (one-line) or conditional. **Expression** is protected and calculated only server-side.
- **Validation** - each **Field** has specific requirements to be met. Incorrect values make it impossible to calculate the price and add the product to the cart.
- **Global Parameters** - are numeric variables which can be used in formulas across all fieldsets.

## Conflict with other plugins 

This plugin has been tested only with Wordpress and Woocommerce without additional plugins.
Note that there may be a conflict with plugins that modifies the product price and user's cart, or has similar functionality. 
This section will be updated and conflicts will be resolved. 

- We know about issue with displaying prices in a cart page. In some themes there's an issue with cart page. Theme should display `cart item price` instead of `product price`. The plugin modifies cart items, but not products itself.
