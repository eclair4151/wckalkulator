You can sell products by anything. You are not limited to sell only by length, area, volume, etc. **You decide how the prices will be calculated.**

## What makes **WC Kalkulator** unique ?

When designing the functionality of the plugin, we wanted to obtain software that would be easy to use and **highly configurable** and **suitable for any** type of store. 

The plugin allows **full freedom** to define fields and formulas for calculating the price. 
Some of fields are not used in formulas, but you can use it to get informations from Customer (for example: text, date, date range, color, dropdown, etc.)

The plugin is designed to work with multisite mode. We encourage you to contact us and request new features.

## Definitions

- **Field** - is used to get user's input on the woocommerce product page. Custom Field can be used to calculate the price (is used in formula)

- **Fieldset** - store manager can create the fieldset (set of custom product fields) which consists of different **Fields**. Fieldset must have at least one **Field** and the expression (formula) to calculate the product price

- **Expression/Formula** - mathematical and/or logical expression using to calculate the woocommerce custom price. The expression can be single-line (one-line) or conditional. **Expression** is protected and calculated only server-side.

- **Validation** - each **Field** has specific requirements to be met. Incorrect values make it impossible to calculate the woocommerce custom price and add the product to the cart.

- **Global Parameters** - are numeric variables which can be used in formulas across all fieldsets.

### Formula/Expression Builder

Use field's values as variables to calculate product price. Drag&drop conditional statements.

### Price Add-Ons

Use custom fields to make Product Add-Ons. This feature is experimental and will be continued in the next releases.

### Display Fields

Assign fields to products, categories or product tags. Include/exclude options.
Mass assignment.

### Validation

Each field has built-in validation tests on user input. You can define additional conditions.

### Protected Formula

The price is calculated server-side only, so the Client can't see exact expression.

### Advanced Customization

Field HTML templates can be overloaded in your theme file. Each field has CSS class to set custom styles.

### Functions

You can use basic math functions in the formula. Fields such as Multi-checkbox, Date Picker, Date Range Picker has additional functions to get sum, min, max value or get date, days between dates values as number.

### Global Parameters
